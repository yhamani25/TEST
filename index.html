<h1>VIDEO</h1>
<p>- Photographic images that are played back at speeds of 15 to 30 frames a second and the provide the appearance of full motion.</p>
<p>- Is the technology of capturing, recording, processing,transmitting, and reconstructing moving pictures?</p>
<p>- Video is more towards photo realistic image sequence / live recording as in comparison
to animation.</p>
<p>- Video also takes a lot of storage space. So plan carefully before you are going to use
it.</p>
<br>
<h1>What is Video Production?</h1>
<p>Video production is basically the entire process of creating a video. Whether it's a
short film, a full-length movie, business marketing video,television commercial, music
video, or other type of film,the process may vary a little with the specifics, but the overall
process is basically the same. The basic process can be broken down into three subcategories.</p>
<br>
<h1>1. Pre-production</h1>
<h1>2. Production</h1>
<h1>3. Post-production.</h1>
<p>These three subcategories include all aspects of video production, from the moment an idea pops into your head to the moment the film is released to the public. In this article,we will attempt to provide you with the clear definition of video production by explaining the entire process of video production.</p>
<br>
<h1>The 3 Main Stages of Video Production</h1>
<h1>1. Pre-production.</h1>
<p>This is the planning stage. There will be no recording during this process, just preparation.</p>
<p>- An idea is formed</p>
<p>- The script is written.</p>
<p>- The cast is selected.</p>
<p>- The audio and video crew members are chosen.</p>
<br>
<p>Everything is organized in preparation for the recording process.Scene locations are selected, the script is edited and revised if necessary,and an outline of the entire recording process is created.there are many additional factors that must be reviewed as well. Proper lighting for each scene is critical. Sunlight and artificial lighting do not often mix well,so the time of day, weather conditions,and location for each scene must be carefully chosen.</p>
<br>
<h1>2. Production</h1>
<p>Once all the cast and crew have been hired, and the script has been edited and approved, the actual production process can begin.Crew and cast members all travel to each location, and each scene is shot until it is satisfactory. Then everyone will move to the next scene.This process repeats until every scene in the film has been shot.Once each scene has been properly shot,
it's time to move on to the next stage of post-production.<p>
<br>
<h1>3. Post-production</h1>
<p>Post-Production covers all actions that are performed after the actual shooting of the film has been completed.This includes merging each scene, syncing audio and video,editing audio and video, and adding special effects.</p>
